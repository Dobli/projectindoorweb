The toolbar is the main navigation element of the site. It is available at all pages which makes the navigation easy. Since the project makes use of the single page application, the toolbar is not required to be added in each html page and needs to be implemented only at one place.

The toolbar has two options represented with following icons.


 Once the menu button  ![Toolbar](images/ic_menu_black_24dp_1x.png) is clicked, the following side bar will appear.
